  * "Today only, two for one on theorems"
  * (a + b) \cdot (a - b) = a^2 - b^2 (diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, Thales theorem)
  * (a + b)^2 - (a - b)^2 = 4 a \cdot b (diagonals of a rectangle are equal, median of an equilateral triangle is perpendicular to opposite leg)
  * (a + b)^2 + (a - b)^2 = 2(a^2 + b^2) (sums of squares of diagonals is twice sums of squares of sides)
  * (a + b) \wedge (a - b) = 2 a \wedge b (diagonals form parallelogram with twice the area as the original)
  * Can we prove that if one angle of a parallelogram is 90 degrees, then other is?
    - abb(-a)= - a^2 b^2 always
    - If ab = a \wedge b, then b(-a) = b \wedge (-a) = a \wedge b

- [ * n ways of representing condition that vectors are perpendicular
    * Take a and b as unit vectors
    * (ab)(ab) = -1 (angle bisects straight angle)
    * a(bab) = -1 => bab = -a (reflecting a across b reverses it)
    * (aba)b = -1 => aba = -b (reflecting b across a reverses it)
    * ab = -ba (reversing angle negates it; this one is a little weird to interpret)
    * ab + ba = 0 => a \cdot b = 0 (vectors have zero dot product)
    * (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + a \cdot b = a^2 + b^2 (sides of a triangle satisfy pythagorean theorem)
    * (alpha a + beta b) = (alpha a)^2 + (beta b)^2 (every triangle with legs proportional to a and b satisfies pythagorean theorem)

    Argand diagram--pick a reference vector
    Should be able to prove everything about plane geometry using a weaker algebra where the reference vector is not in the plane
- [ ] ... something about 3D
  * e1(e1+e2)e2(Ee2+e3)e3(e3+e1) = e1(e1+e2)(e2+e3)(e3+e1) = (e1+e2)(e2+e3)(e3+e1)e1
  * As two sided rotation, e1 is an eigenvector, rotates in e2 \wedge e3 plane
  * Scalar when (e1+e2)(e2+e3)(e3+e1) is planar, (i.e. when e1, e2, e3 are)
