    <abbr class="date">28 Feb 2017</abbr>
    <p><p>I have a confession to make: I have always found symbolic algebra more intuitive than geometric pictures. I think you’re supposed to feel the opposite way, and I greatly admire people who think and communicate in pictures, but for me, it’s usually a struggle.</p>

<p>For example, I have seen many pictorial “proofs without words” of the Pythagorean Theorem. I find some of them to be quite beautiful, but I also often find them difficult to unpack, and I never really think “oh, I could have come up with that myself.”</p>

<p>Here’s Pythagoras’ own proof<label for="faulk-pythagoras-image" class="margin-toggle"><sup>⊕</sup></label><input type="checkbox" id="faulk-pythagoras-image" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem#/media/File:Pythagoras-proof-anim.svg">Image by William B. Faulk</a>, lifted from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem">Pythagorean Theorem Wikipedia Page</a>. It’s worth looking at some of the many other visual proofs given there.</span>:</p>

<figure class="mainfig">
  <img alt="Pythagoras' visual proof of the Pythagorean theorem." src="/img/geometry-algebra-intuition/pythagoras-original-proof.png" style="width: 653px;" />
</figure>

<p>I like this proof a lot. It’s fairly simple to interpret (more so than some of the other examples in the genre), and quite convincing. We have</p>

<p><span class="display-latex">
  c^2 = a^2 + b^2
</span></p>

<p>because, along with the same four copies of a triangle, both sides of this equation fill up an identical area.</p>

<p>Even so, it’s odd to me that this diagram involves four copies of the triangle. This is one of those “I couldn’t have come up with this myself” stumbling blocks.</p>

<p>For comparison, I’ll give an algebraic proof<label for="proof-caveat" class="margin-toggle"><sup>⊕</sup></label><input type="checkbox" id="proof-caveat" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Here and throughout I am using the word “proof” quite loosely. Forgive me, I am a physicist, not a mathematician.</span> of the Pythagorean theorem using vectors. The condition that three vectors <span class="mathquill-embedded-latex">a</span>, <span class="mathquill-embedded-latex">b</span>, and <span class="mathquill-embedded-latex">c</span> traverse a triangle is that their sum is zero:</p>

<p><span class="display-latex">
  a + b + c = 0
</span></p>

<p>Solving for <span class="mathquill-embedded-latex">c</span> gives</p>

<p><span class="display-latex">
  c = -(a+b)
</span></p>

<p>and then dotting each side with itself and distributing gives</p>

<p><span class="display-latex">
  \begin{aligned<em>}
  c \cdot c &amp;= \left(a+b\right) \cdot \left(a + b\right) \\
    &amp;= a \cdot a + a \cdot b + b \cdot a + b \cdot b \\
    &amp;= a^2 + b^2 + 2 a \cdot b
  \end{aligned</em>}
</span></p>

<p>The condition that vectors <span class="mathquill-embedded-latex">a</span> and <span class="mathquill-embedded-latex">b</span> form a right angle is just that <span class="mathquill-embedded-latex">a \cdot b = 0</span>, and in that special case, we have the Pythagorean theorem:</p>

<p><span class="display-latex">
  c^2 = a^2 + b^2
</span></p>

<p>The thing I like about this algebraic manipulation is that it is a straightforward application of simple rules in sequence. There are dozens of ways to arrange 4 congruent triangles on a page (probably much more than dozens, really), but the algebra feels almost inevitable<label for="practice-the-rules" class="margin-toggle"><sup>⊕</sup></label><input type="checkbox" id="practice-the-rules" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">It does take practice to get a feel for which rules to apply to achieve a given goal, but there are really only a few rules to try: distributivity, commutativity, associativity, linearity over scalar multiplication, and that’s about it.</span>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write down the algebraic condition that vectors forming the sides of any triangle must satisfy.</li>
  <li>We’re interested in a function of one of the side vectors, <span class="mathquill-embedded-latex">c^2</span>, so we solve for <span class="mathquill-embedded-latex">c</span> and apply the function to both sides.</li>
  <li>We transform the right hand side by applying distributivity of the dot product across addition, and commutativity of the dot product, i.e. <span class="mathquill-embedded-latex">a \cdot b = b \cdot a</span>.</li>
  <li>Right triangles in particular are a simplifying special case where one term drops out.</li>
</ol>

<p>I also think it’s important that the algebraic manipulation embeds the Pythagorean theorem as a special case of a relationship that holds for all triangles: the Law of Cosines<label for="law-of-cosines" class="margin-toggle"><sup>⊕</sup></label><input type="checkbox" id="law-of-cosines" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">The following diagram shows the relationship between the vector form of the law of cosines, <span class="mathquill-embedded-latex">c^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2 a \cdot b</span>, and the angle form of the law of cosines, <span class="mathquill-embedded-latex">c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2 |a||b|\cos C</span> <img src="/img/geometry-algebra-intuition/law-of-cosines-triangle.png" style="width: 213px" /> In the angle form, <span class="mathquill-embedded-latex">C</span> is an interior angle, but in the vector form, if <span class="mathquill-embedded-latex">a \cdot b = |a||b|\cos(\theta_{ab})</span>, then <span class="mathquill-embedded-latex">\theta_{ab}</span> is an exterior angle. This is the origin of the difference in sign of the final term between the two forms.</span>. If you have a theorem about right triangles, then you’d really like to know whether it’s ever true for non-right triangles, and how exactly it breaks down in cases where it isn’t true. Perhaps there’s a good way to deform Pythagoras’ picture to illustrate the law of cosines, but I don’t believe I’ve seen it.</p>

<p>For these reasons, I’ve generally been satisfied with the algebraic way of thinking about the Pythagorean theorem. So satisfied, I recently realized, that I’ve barely even tried to think about what pictures would “naturally” illustrate the algebraic manipulation.</p>

<p>In the remainder of this post, I plan to remedy this complacency.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2016/12/12/sunset-geometry/">Sunset Geometry</a></h2>
    <abbr class="date">12 Dec 2016</abbr>
    <p><p>Robert Vanderbei has written a <a href="http://orfe.princeton.edu/~rvdb/tex/sunset/ms.pdf">beautiful</a> <a href="http://orfe.princeton.edu/~rvdb/tex/sunset/34-39.OPN.1108twoup.pdf">series</a> of <a href="http://orfe.princeton.edu/~rvdb/tex/sunset/sunset.pdf">articles</a> and <a href="http://orfe.princeton.edu/u/rvdb/tex/talks/sunset/sunsetTalk_RutgersREU_small.pdf">talks</a> about a method for finding the radius of the earth based on a single photograph of a sunset over a large, calm lake.</p>

<p>Vanderbei’s analysis is an elegant and subtle exercise in classical trigonometry. In this post, I would like to present an alternative analysis in a different language: Geometric Algebra. I believe that geometric algebra is a more powerful system for formulating and solving trigonometry problems than the classical “lengths and angles” approach, and it deserves to be better known. Vanderbei’s sunset problem is simple to understand and challenging to solve, so it makes a nice benchmark.</p>

<p>Here’s Vanderbei’s sunset problem. If the earth was flat, photographs of the sun setting over water would look like this:</p>

<div>
<img alt="Flat earth sunset diagram" src="/img/sunset-flat.png" />
</div>

<p>Notice that the reflection dips just as far below the horizon as the sun peaks above it.</p>

<p>Actual photographs of the sun setting over calm water (<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb/Sunset-crop-lossless.jpg">like Vanderbei’s</a><label for="photo-skepticism" class="margin-toggle"><sup>⊕</sup></label><input type="checkbox" id="photo-skepticism" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Update: I should have been more careful to note that most photographs of sunsets over water actually don’t look like Vanderbei’s photograph (or my diagram) because of waves and atmospheric effects, and that sensor saturation artifacts make it hard to interpret images like this. Reproducing Vanderbei’s image may be somewhere between hard and impossible. <a href="#skepticism">More Below</a>.</span>) look more like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro">Kakuro</a> is a number puzzle that is a bit like a combination between Sudoku and a crossword puzzle. Imagine a crossword puzzle where, instead of words, blocks of boxes are filled with combinations of digits between 1 and 9, and instead of clues about words, you are given sums that a block of digits must add up to.</p>

<p>When you’re solving a Kakuro puzzle, it’s helpful to be able to generate all the combinations of <em>m</em> different digits that add up to a given sum. A <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/julia-users/xJ7GpKAa16E/ZnaWuHZKBQAJ">recent thread</a> on the julia-users mailing list considered how to implement this task efficiently on a computer.</p>

<p>In this post, I’d like to show a progression of a few different implementations of the solution of this same problem. I think the progression shows off one of Julia’s core strengths: in a single language, you are free to think in either a high level way that is close to your problem domain and easy to prototype, or a low level way that pays more attention to the details of efficient machine execution. I don’t know any other system that even comes close to making it as easy to switch back and forth between these modes as Julia does.</p>

<p><em>Attention Conservation Notice</em>: If you’re looking for information on how to solve Kakuro with a computer, you should probably look elsewhere. This post is a deep dive into a tiny, tiny subproblem. On the other hand, I’ll show how to speed up the solution of this tiny, tiny subproblem by a factor of either ten thousand or a million, depending how you count, so if that sounds fun you’re in the right place.</p>

<p>Bisection is about the simplest algorithm there is for isolating a root of a continuous function:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start with an interval such that the function takes on oppositely signed values on the endpoints.</li>
  <li>Split the interval at its midpoint.</li>
  <li>Recurse into whichever half has endpoints on which the function takes on oppositely signed values.</li>
</ol>

<p>After each step, the new interval is half as large as the previous interval and still contains at least one zero (by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem">Intermediate Value Theorem</a>).</p>

<p>I want to highlight a couple of interesting issues that arise when implementing bisection in floating point arithmetic that you might miss if you just looked at the definition of the algorithm.</p>
