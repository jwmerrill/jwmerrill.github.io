title: Mowing a Spherical Lawn
---

How would you mow a spherical lawn?

Goal is to end up approximately tangent to where you were on the last pass, offset by one mower's width.

Can think of starting at the equator, and mowing an "almost circle" that ends up one mower's width above the equator when you get back to your starting latitude. Pattern continues until you mow a tight circle at a pole.

Can then thinking of actually starting at a pole and mowing the reverse of this pattern, which will eventually get you to the other pole.

What is this shape (I think it's some kind of loxodrome).

Show a picture of spiral-peeling a potato.
